"""DWARF-based extraction of the source lines compiled into a build.

This reads the line tables from the DWARF debug info in the object files of a
build and works out which lines of each source file generated code. It is
shared by codman (multi-board code analysis) and buildman (per-commit build
footprint), so the two tools produce comparable data.

The extraction works on '.o' files (not the linked image), so it sees every
line that was compiled, including code later dropped by the linker. The build
must be made without LTO, since with LTO the object files hold GIMPLE rather
than machine code and carry no useful line table.
