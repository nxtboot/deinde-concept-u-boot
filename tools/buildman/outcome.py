        func_sizes: Dictionary keyed by filename - e.g. 'u-boot'. Each
                value is itself a dictionary:

                    value: Size of function in bytes
        config: Dictionary keyed by filename - e.g. '.config'. Each

                    value: config value
        environment: Dictionary keyed by environment variable, Each
                 value is the value of environment variable.
        lines: Dictionary keyed by source filename relative to the source
                tree. Each value is a set of line numbers (ints) which
                generated code in this build, as found from DWARF debug info.
